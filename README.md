Equitas Transaction System could refer to a specific project, financial system, or platform developed by Equitas, a financial services company. Equitas is known for its work in providing financial services to individuals, SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), and other sectors, particularly in India.

If you're referring to a specific project, it could involve elements like financial transactions, mobile banking, payments systems, loan disbursement systems, or even blockchain-based solutions, depending on the context. However, there isn't a universally recognized project by this name (as of my last update), so the details could vary.
